                    <p>Two men at 4:30PM were brutally stabbed in the dangerous neighborhood of Idlewood.
                        This comes after a recent string of gang-related attacks within the area, conducted by
                        the well-known Bloods and Crips families.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The victims of the attack are currently yet
                        to be identified, however authorities claim that the two men were aged between 20 to 25
                        years, and were African-American.

                    </div>
                    <p>First, figure out a diet plan. A good diet plan consists of green vegetables,
                        fruits, chicken breasts and low carbs. Avoid eating processed foods like chips,
                        biscuits, candies and stick to raw ingredients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Second, spare atleast 30 minutes a day to lifting weights. Lifting weights not only
                        builds your muscles, but also burns the fat at a much quicker and healthier pace, leaving
                        no marks behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, do cardio. Most people avoid this step, simply because it seems daunting to them.
                        However, any weight-loss expert will tell you how important cardio is. To make it fun for
                        yourself, try incorporating sports into your cardio routine. Good examples are football, 
                        basketball and even tennis.

                    <p>A charity boxing match between Secretary of State candidate, Michael Appelo and semi-professional boxer, 
                        Daniel Zanetti was arranged at Connolly's Gym on the 4th of July, 2019. The charity boxing match was 
                        held to raise funds for the Hope For The Warriors organization, which provides assistance to combat 
                        wounded service members, their families, and families of martyred.

                    </figure>
                    <p>According to spectators, the fight seemed to be one sided. One individual at the gym, when talking to 
                        Metro7, claimed that the fight was a staged publicity stunt. While the allegation may sound absurd 
                        or baseless, it may or may not be true. Among the only 30 spectators present to witness the fight, 
                        another Secretary of State candidate , Megan Granville, was present to support Mike Appelo.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>A few days ago, Metro7 was invited to attend one of these private car meets and we couldn't miss this 
                        perfect opportunity to explore the community of young racers. Suffice to say, the scenes at this 
                        semi-organized meet were absolutely ridiculous.

                    <p>The whole experience was not what we had anticipated it to be. It may seem fun to some but this type 
                        of hooliganism is often frowned upon by other motorists, including some enthusiasts. These people 
                        put hundreds of lives, including their own, at risk. With street racing being one of the leading 
                        causes for road accidents, serious action needs to be taken by authorities to stop these semi-organized 
                        events which oftentimes lead to irreversible losses.</p>
